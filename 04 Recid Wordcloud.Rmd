##  Simplify Text for recidivism crimes-- Often, one would want to stem the words used (to take down to the root), but using it resulted in strange words (i.e. Battery was turned into batteri)
recidCorpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(c(risk$r_crime))) 
dtm_r <- DocumentTermMatrix(c(recidCorpus),
           control = list(tolower = TRUE,
                          removePunctuation = TRUE,
                          removeNumbers = TRUE,
                          stopwords = TRUE))

## Determine the most frequent words
freq_r <- colSums(as.matrix(dtm_r))
ord_r <- order(freq_r)
freq_r[tail(ord_r)]

freq_r <- sort(colSums(as.matrix(dtm_r)),decreasing=TRUE)
head(freq_r)

##Create a Word Cloud
set.seed(190)
wordcloud(names(freq_r), freq_r, min.freq = 30, max.words=100, colors=brewer.pal(6,"Dark2"))
